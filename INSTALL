INSTALLATION
============


Requirements
------------

- One of the following operating systems:
  -- Linux (tested with Ubuntu 9.04, 9.10, 10.04, 10.10)
  -- Mac OS X (tested with OS X 10.6)
  Other operating systems might work also, but have not been tested. 
  Let us know if you managed to get it work on any other system.

- Python version 2.6 or later.
- Python setuptools

- GEOS, GDAL, PROJ.4 and SQLite libraries

- The following Python modules are mandatory for running i2maps:
  django, geos, gdal, numpy, sqlite

- For some functions, PostGIS is strongly recommended.

- In order to have the full functionality, the following Python modules are needed additionally:
  psycopg2, geojson, shapely




Installation on Ubuntu
----------------------

- Install the following libraries and modules with all dependencies directly using the APT system: 
  python-django, libgdal1-1.6.0, gdal-bin, libgeos-3.2.0, libproj0, libsqlite3-0, python-numpy, python-setuptools

- Install the django Python package using the setuptools:
  sudo easy_install django

- Download the i2maps package from https://github.com/NCG/i2maps/ and extract the archive.

- In the Terminal, cd into the downloaded folder, and run sudo python setup.py install

- Copy the i2maps_working_dir folder from the i2maps archive to a convenient location (e.g. in your home folder).

- Start the i2maps development server using the following commands. 
  Put the correct path to your i2maps package (on the first line) 
  and i2maps working directory (on the second line).

  cd /usr/local/lib/python2.6/dist-packages/i2maps
  export i2maps_working_directory=/path/to/your/i2maps_working_dir/ 
  python i2maps_server.py
	
  You should have the following output:
  i2maps development server is running at http://127.0.0.1:8000/ 
  i2maps working directory: /home/christian/i2maps_working_dir/
  Quit the server with CONTROL-C.
	
  If yes, everything went fine. Leave the window open until you don't need the i2maps server anymore. Go to your favourite browser (we recommend Google Chrome), and go to http://127.0.0.1:8000/ and then http://127.0.0.1:8000/projects/example1/index.html.
	


	
Installation on Mac OS X (Snow Leopard)
---------------------------------------

The procedure is quite similar to Ubuntu, except that there is no APT system, of course.
Here just a rough procedure.

- Install the following frameworks from http://www.kyngchaos.com: UnixImageIO, PROJ, GEOS, SQLite3, GDAL. There might be a convenience installer "GDAL Complete" installing at once all the mentioned frameworks.

- Install the Python setuptools (see http://pypi.python.org/pypi/setuptools)

- All the rest is exactly the same as for Ubuntu (starting with the django Python package).
